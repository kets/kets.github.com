About
I am 26 years old programmer, hacker.
Since Jaunary 2010, I've been employed as a 'Senior Development Engineer' for Calsoft, Pune.
This is where I hope, I can share my thoughts, adventures in my life, photos, codes and all nice things I am excited about.
You can follow me on Twitter, hear my musical tastes on Last.fm
Feel free to drop me an e-mail, anil@digitalcodes.org
